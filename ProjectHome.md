This plugin enables developers to create and post [ReviewBoard](http://www.reviewboard.org/) code review requests, from within the [NetBeans](http://netbeans.org/) IDE.

Developers can create one or more ReviewBoard review requests, populate the details and submit them from within the NetBeans IDE. Developers can view the diff of each file before they submit for code review from within the same dialog. Currently it supports Subversion and Git; future versions are expected to support more popular version control systems.
